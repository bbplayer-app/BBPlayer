# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive local playlist management functionality for BBPlayer, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete local playlists stored in the SQLite database. This complements the existing online-only approach by providing offline playlist capabilities and better user control over their music collections.
